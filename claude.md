## CSS and style guidelines

- Don't absolutely position things unless absolutely necessary
- Use flexbox and/or grid instead
- Make sure components are styled responsively
- Make sure styles are accessible (enough contrast between foreground and background color)
- Don't apply styles via TypeScript unless absolutely necessary, create CSS modules instead if more custom styles are required
